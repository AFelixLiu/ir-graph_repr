# README

This repo is a local reproduction of the paper ***"[Infrared spectra prediction using attention-based graph neural networks](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2024/dd/d3dd00254c)"***, with code from [nj-saquer/IR-Spectra-Prediction-Graph-Models (github.com)](https://github.com/nj-saquer/IR-Spectra-Prediction-Graph-Models/)



The NIST IR spectra dataset that can  be scraped by running

* `_1_NIST_Spectra_Scraper.py`, 
* `_2_NIST_Preprocessor.ipynb`, 
* and `_3_NIST_Molecule_Selector.ipynb` **in order.**



The model is trained and tested by running the `Spectra_Predictor_GColab.ipynb` file
